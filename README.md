# vim-paragraph
A simple paragraph for working with text files, this allows for hard word wrapping ideal for working with Latex and Markdown files


## Functionality
Vim will automatically hard wrap your lines allowing for easier line navigation on long lines of text such as paragraphs on
.tex and .md files

### Ctrl-hjkl
While on insert mode vim-paragraph allows you to use the famous hjkl without leaving insert mode while holding Ctrl. Never
reach for those arrow keys again.
